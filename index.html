											<h3>TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM</h3> 
											<h3>What I learn from this whole program are the degree that we have one day should empower us to get a better job. Other than that, we also need to
												start everything as early as possible because we don’t know what happen in future but the best thing always comes first. I also think that we should
												make some time to participate in a lot of activities because by joining these activities , it can build our teamwork , communication skills , brave and also
												gain knowledge from those activities. Our social networking also can be expanded because we always meet new people and that can train us how
												to handle with people’s personality and fit in society. I also think by visiting the Huawei Company and also Exxon Mobile by Petronas in Kuala Lumpur , i can develop more interest in Technology.
												it is because I found it is very interesting to gain a lot of knowledge from the talk by employers in Exxon Mobile and I have a lot of fun . It also inspire me on how to get a better job 
												with convenient workplace because I think Exxon Mobile has very cozy workplace that i really like. Other than that, by visiting Huawei exhibition , I discover a lot of good technology that 
												big organization would use and I think it is very impressive to have qNa session with the worker there.I learned that UTM digital have a lot of facilities and services that can fullfill user need in UTM.
												I also discovered about help desk that helps to assist student and even staff about UTM Digital. This visit also helped me in knowing more about information system and features available in UTM Digital.
												The overall information about each of the places in UTM digital are well explained. It is also my first time visiting data centre and seeing it in person made me want to learn more about the technology nowadays.</h3>

											<h3>DIGITAL LOGIC</h3>
											<h3>I believe that mastering Digital Logic increased my knowledge of electronic topics. 
												All microprocessor-based systems, such as those in computers, robotics, cars, and industrial control systems, 
												are built on digital electronics. It gives me a general introduction to digital electronics and covers a lot of 
												significant ideas, parts, and instruments. I received comprehensive education on digital principles, ranging from
												 fundamental ideas to programmable logic devices. Additionally, I had the opportunity to attempt something new by 
												 conducting laboratory experiments using the simulator software and real devices and circuits that were covered in class.

											<h3>DISCRETE STRUCTURE</h3>
											<h3>I am convinced that studying discrete structure has exposed me to the ideas behind and practical
												 uses of the concept in computer science. Set theory, proving strategies, relations, functions, 
												 recurrence relations, counting techniques, graph theory, trees, and finite automata are among the subjects 
												 studied in this course. By the end, I knew how to model electronic devices and issues using deterministic 
												 finite automata finite state machines, analyse and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting techniques,
												  apply graph theory and trees to real-world problems, and use set theory, relations, and functions to solve computer science problems.

											<h3>PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE</h3>
											<h3>As a computer science student, I believe that mastering anything about programming and coding is essential. 
												This training provides me with theory and practice in structured approach problem solving strategies. 
												I now know how to use the C++ programming language to create programmes that tackle easy to moderate problems.

											<h3>INTEGRITI DAN JATI DIRI</h3>
											<h3>The most crucial factor in today's workplace, in my opinion, is integrity. Attending a UTM integrity seminar has shown me how crucial it is to 
												develop an honest character when interacting with others. This will increase our worker's credibility. The level of respect and trust you get from 
												others is your credibility. When you act with integrity, you convey dependability, accountability, and transparency. In addition, it could improve our reputation
												because people with integrity are known for being trustworthy, moral, and reliable. You also show that you have concern for 
												the calibre of your output, the welfare of your group, and the objectives of your company.</h3>
